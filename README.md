## Refactoring a given wedsite's codes ##

-- Error has been corrected and improvements have been made as follows:

-- Navigation issue has been fixed at header by adding nav tag and proper id attribute

-- All images have been attached an alt tag for screen reader to enable accessibility

-- Some semantic elements such as main, section, article, aside have been added instead of div to make more semantic and logical sense.

-- Class name of big picture has been changed to a related name: "meeting-image" instead of "hero" and the img tag has been moved from CSS file to HTML file to make consistent with other img tag

-- Class names in main and aside have been modified for optimisation in HTML file.
